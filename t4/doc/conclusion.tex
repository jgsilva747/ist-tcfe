\section{Conclusion}
\label{con}

\par As discussed in the introduction, the main objective was to design and compute an electrical circuit that could recreate an audio amplifier circuit. As so, both theorical analysis and simulation analyses were conducted. 

\par Due to the non-linearity of the components of the circuit, particularly the transistors, it was very difficult to obtain the exact same quality using the tools available. In this sense, the results provided by NGSpice are more reliable, since in the theoretical analysis, a simpler transistor model was used.
