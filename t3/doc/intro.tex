% state the learning objective 
The objective of this laboratory assignment is to convert an alternated current signal with 230V, 50Hz, to a 12V direct current source, using an envelope detector and a voltage regulator.\par
The circuit was simulated in NGSpice, with a theoretical prediction in Octave. The merit of this work is related to the ripple and cost of the components: the less ripple and the lower the cost, the higher the merit. In this assignment, the merit obtained was aproximately 0,26. 

The merit is calculated using the following expression:\par
\begin{equation}
    M = \frac{1}{Cost(ripple(v_0)+average(v_0-12)+10^{-6})}
\end{equation}\par
Where: \par
Cost = cost of resistors + cost of capacitors + cost of diodes \par
Cost of Resistors = 1 monetary unit per kOhm \par
Cost of capacitor = 1 monetary unit per $\mu$ F \par
Cost of diodes = 0.1Monetary units per diode \par
The final circuit obtainned is the one shown below in figure (Fig.\ref{fig:circuito}): \par
