\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This assignment made us understand how a band pass filter work and how an OP-AMP circuit relates to and the band and the voltage gain.\par
As it can be noticed, there are some differences between the theoretical and simulation values obtained, this is the case for the OP analysis and also the impedances. This difference is explained by the use of non-linear components (transistors) that make the OP analysis deviate from the theoretical analysis. Since the linear components have constant circuit parameters, it is really easy for Ngspice to plot and analyse them in perfection in relationship to the theorethical calculations. It cannot be said the same thing for non-linear components, once those circuit parameters vary. \par
The merit figure as explained before was a very important part of this assignment, since it provides a relation with the "real world" where everything as a cost and a energy consumption, so it was important that this value was the most accurate as possible. In order to achieve that, the Ngspice's result was used. \par
As it can be way easier to compare, it is shown below the results from simulation and theoretical analysis side by side: \par
