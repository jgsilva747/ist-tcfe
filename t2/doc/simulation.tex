\subsection{Operating Point Analysis}

Table~\ref{tab:op} shows the simulated operating point results for the circuit
under analysis. It is important to note the creation of an auxiliary node, N8, as well 
as a fictional voltage source, V3 (providing 0V in order not to affect the rest of the circuit). 
This creation is due to no theoretical reason whatsoever and it's only necessary because of Ngspice 
software requirements for defining a current controlled voltage source.

\textbf{Note:}
A variable preceded by @ is of type {\em current}
    and expressed in Ampere; other variables are of type {\it voltage} and expressed in Volt.

 As it can be seen, the simulation results coincide up to the last digit with the theoretical results.
