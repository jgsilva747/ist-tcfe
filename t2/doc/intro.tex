% state the learning objective 
The objective of this laboratory assignment is to study a circuit containing two independent and two linearly dependent sources. $V_a$ is the independent voltage source and $I_d$ is the independent current source.
\par The voltage controlled current source $I_b$ is determined by $K_b \cdot V_b$, and the current controlled voltage source $V_c$ is calculated with $K_c \cdot I_c$.
The circuit can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:Circuit}, where it is found that along with these sources, the circuit is composed of seven more resistors, named $R_1$, $R_2$, ..., $R_7$.
\par The resistor values were obtained from a \textit{Python} script, given by the professor and using the student number 95802 to generate the data. These values are shown in the table below, where names starting with R represent resistors, and the units are \textit{kOhm} (kiloohm). $K_b$ is given in \textit{mS} (millisiemens), whereas $K_c$ is expressed in \textit{kOhm}. $V_a$ and $I_c$ are expressed in \textit{V} (volt) and \textit{mA} (milliampere), respectively.

In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, two theoretical analysis of the circuit are
presented, using the mesh method and the node method. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by
simulation, and the results are compared to the theoretical results obtained in
Section~\ref{sec:analysis}. The conclusions of this study are outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
